# Nim website development

The Nim website hosted on https://nim-lang.org.

## Developing

Install Jekyll, then `cd jekyll` and use `bundle exec jekyll serve`
to serve to a local Web server with automatic refresh on changes.

## Adding your Project to "Month with Nim"
Fork and modify the next month's `this-month-with-nim.md` in the `jekyll/_posts` folder then make a PR to this repo. If that file doesnt exist, copy `jekyll/assets/this-month-with-nim.md` there adding the correct date of the first of the next month. Adding any required sources to the `jekyll/assets/thismonthwithnim` folder.

First come first serve, add your project to the bottom of the last project.

Below is a simple template to follow:
```
## YourProjectName

Author: YourName or Nickname here

Your super cool description here maybe even an image, video, or link.
```
