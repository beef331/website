### discoverAssets

while working on a game i discovered that being an indie game developer is really difficult partly due to the fact that you are required to create your own game assets
so i made this search engine entirely in nim using [jester](https://github.com/dom96/jester) and [karax](https://github.com/pragmagic/karax). This 
[discoverassets](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwjDhcegpajuAhVPDmMBHfFaCf0QFjAAegQIARAC&url=http%3A%2F%2Fdiscoverassets.website%2F&usg=AOvVaw0oK9liYd2xnWR2BdVQgSW2)
helps scrape a few websites and delivers free game assets on those websites.
